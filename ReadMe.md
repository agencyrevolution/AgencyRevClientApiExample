# .Net Api Wrapper with C# Example

This project contains our .Net Api Wrapper and a C# wrapper.  We have examples of using both XML and Json. 

The code is quite simple and can be read through to understand how it works. Your application only needs to make one async call to the `ClientApiWrapper.Controller.PostAccount(Account Object, Account Id, Username, Password, Submit Data Type)` function.

The complete example can be seen from `ClientApiExample.Test.btnSubmit_Click` or `ClientApiExample.Test.btnSubmitJson_Click`
